**Inventor: Jovonte Marcellino**  
**Date: June 2025**

## 📘 Overview
This project explores how spatial coil geometry and wire gauge imbalance can induce torque in a levitating magnet — using only direct current. The discovery demonstrates that by layering coils in opposite directions with varying gauges, one can physically induce rotational magnetic asymmetry without alternating current.

## ⚙️ Concept Summary
- **Primary winding**: Thin gauge copper wire, clockwise direction.
- **Secondary winding**: Thicker gauge wire, counterclockwise, layered on top.
- **Result**: Field asymmetry induces circular torque, causing a levitated magnet to spin.

## 🧲 Key Principles
- The system mimics an electromagnetic transformer, but with **unbalanced spatial flux**.
- The **secondary coil doesn’t need to be powered** — proximity alone causes magnetic interaction.
- The **magnet reacts to the induced angular momentum** created by the opposing coil geometries.

## 🔬 Significance
- Demonstrates that **magnetic waveforms can be physically embedded** via coil design.
- Opens door to **solid-state spin motors** and **programmable field control**.
- Potential applications in **levitation control**, **contactless motion systems**, and **energy dynamics**.
